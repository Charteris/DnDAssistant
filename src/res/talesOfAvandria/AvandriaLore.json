      "Long ago, the land of Avandria was ruled by a legion of ancient dragons. This legion consisted of dragons from many alignments including ancient red, black, green, white, and cromium dragons which formed an understanding of their own dominions with which they held throughout the lands of Avandria, leading to only minor disputes among the colours. They expected offerings from the citizens of Avandria in return for keeping the lands safe from other regions. Majority of the citizens accepted this offer and provided food, riches, and artefacts for the dragons, some even commiting themselves to raise the offspring and birth they're own dragonborn offspring.",
      "The lands were peaceful and the majority whom were sacrified were honoured to serve such as significant purpose, however, as generations passed, younger races grew to become dissatisfied with the dragons rule and dreamt of a better realm where they would prospour and inherit the riches that were so easily sacrified to their draconic overlords. Rumours of a revolution grew from distant whispers to echoes throughout Avandria which inevitably lead to more frequent territorial battles between the different dragons."

      "Towns across Avandria are commonly ravaged by Bandits where the only assistance from the grand inquisitors is the unrelenting destruction of entire cities by dragon-fire after control is already relinquished to the bandits.",
      "Outer villages are more fortunate as they are merely raided on a consistent basis by bandits and goblins. Many of these lower villages have reached an alliance with competing bandit tribes, paying them everything for protection against other bandit groups and tribes.",
      "The grand inquisitors are ferocious and incredibly powerful controlling most of the lands wealth and decimating any other regions whom claim unfairness in the inquisitors dealings. The most powerful asset of the inquisitors is their refined magical technology which allows them to imprison dragons which can then be trained by the highest warriors of the inquisitors to be used as ferocious weapons against their enemies."

    "content": [
      "Long before the grand inquisitors reign over Avandria, the lands were writhe with ancient dragons whom were worshipped by most. They offered protection against other regions whilst accepting gold, precious minerals, and the occasional human sacrifice from their disciples. Their greatest allies were the Order of the Dragon which were an elite group of warriors and spellcasters - typically Dragonborn - which would lead crusades against Avandria's adversaries.",

      "After the heretics imprisoned the dragons and drove the ancient black dragon - Tynnyr - deep into the underdark, an unlikely ally came to his aid. A small tribe of drow cured his wounds and made a pact with the great spider queen lolth to grant him a wealth of new power. In return, Tynnyr bestowed his knowledge of necromancy and death magic unto a member of the drows elite sorceres - Filraen Despt'tar - a young halfblood woman with great promise due to a powerful fey bloodline.",
