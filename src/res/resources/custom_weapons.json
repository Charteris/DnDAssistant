    "description": "This weapon is bound to the \"voidcaller\" and cannot be transferred or sold. If a transfer is attempted, the sword evaporates into shadow once the voidcaller releases the blade and re-manifests in their hand after. \nThis weapon along with the associated armour can absorb elemental essence which has been bound to any non-ephemeral plane, transforming the blade into one which abides by this element and dealing elemental damage accordingly. At any time, the voidcaller can nullify this effect, reverting the blade to its standard ephemeral form to deal force damage."
